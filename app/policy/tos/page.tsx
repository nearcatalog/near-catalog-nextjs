## Wallet; Exchange and Sale of Digital Assets 

The Services that you access via the Websites and run locally may allow you to create or connect a digital wallet holding digital assets to your account and/or to hold, transfer or otherwise interact with digital assets. You understand that we do not hold your assets and take no custody of them. We have no access to your assets or funds and we do not operate or provide the Tools. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain control of your digital assets on the Services, including those run locally by you, and for trading them or selling them to others. Once you purchase or sell a digital asset, the transaction cannot be canceled or recalled. Once a transaction has been recorded in a digital wallet as instructed when the transaction was initiated, it cannot be recalled or retrieved under any circumstances.

We and our service providers are not responsible for the keys to any digital assets or your seed phrase, or their loss or disclosure to others. It is your responsibility at all times to ensure you have such credentials and maintain them securely. Any losses you suffer as a result of loss of control of, disclosure or unauthorized use of your digital keys is your responsibility and you hereby indemnify us and hold us harmless against any claims or losses arising from your loss of the digital keys to your wallet or their use by third parties. PLEASE KEEP YOUR SEED PHRASE AND DIGITAL KEYS SAFE, AS WE AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE THEM AND DO NOT KNOW THEM. IF YOU LOSE THE KEYS OR SEED PHRASE, YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR ASSETS.

You also understand that we and our service providers do not act as your financial advisors or give you any investment advice of any kind with respect to what assets you choose to hold in your wallet or any trading thereof. As with any trading activities that you elect to undertake on the Services, including those run locally by you, it is your responsibility and you are solely responsible for the contents of your wallet, your purchase decisions, how and when you trade digital assets and with whom. It is also your responsibility to ensure you understand crypto assets, how they work, what their value is, and about trading and purchasing such assets, as there are significant risks in doing so, all of which you solely assume. The wallet you use on the Services may not connect or allow purchase, storage or trading of all virtual currencies or assets.  
We and our service providers may suspend your use of or cancel your use of the Websites or Tools for any reason, including if we or our service providers believe you have engaged in or are about to engage in any kind of fraud, if required pursuant to applicable laws, or you violate these Terms of Use. We or our service providers may provide you with notice of suspension, but do not undertake an obligation to do so.

## Taxes and Fraud 

Depending on your location of residence, you may owe taxes on amounts you earn after selling digital assets, including crypto currencies and non-fungible tokens. It is your responsibility to ensure you have accounted for, reported to the proper governmental authority, and paid all such taxes to the applicable governmental authority. We and our service providers do not undertake any obligation to report any such taxes, nor collect or disburse them on your behalf. The taxes you owe are solely your responsibility. You hold us and our service providers harmless and release us from and against any claims, losses, damages or demands arising in connection with taxes you may owe as a result of your use of the Websites and the Tools.

If we believe that you have engaged in or been a participant in any fraudulent transaction, we reserve the right to take any action we think appropriate, including forwarding your information and information about the transactions we believe or suspect to be fraudulent to applicable law enforcement agencies, which may result in civil or criminal penalties or other actions against you.

## Risks 

To the extent you run any Services, including locally, related to digital assets, you acknowledge and agree that digital assets are volatile and risky, and their trading is affected by many factors outside our or your control. You are solely responsible for any transactions, and for all fees that you may incur as a result of your acquisition or sales of digital assets in connection with you running the Services, including locally. The Websites and the Tools do not control the timing of any transaction (or any other feature, property or characteristic of the Services), yet you acknowledge that the time of a transaction can affect the value of the asset or the fees associated with a transaction or both. You hereby hold us and our service providers harmless against any and all claims arising from the transaction of your digital assets, or the timing of such transactions, in connection with you running the Services related to digital assets, including locally.

Digital assets are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Digital assets are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. We are not a bank, and we and our service providers have no fiduciary duty to you. We and our service providers make no guarantee as to the functionality of any digital asset network that you elect to access and/or use by running the Services, including locally, which might cause delays, conflicts of interest or might be subject to operational decisions of third parties that are unfavorable to you or affect your digital assets, or lead to your inability to complete a transaction using the Services. You hold us and our service providers harmless from and against any losses you suffer as a result of your use of the Services and any third party services, networks, or protocols that relate to the Services, even if you access them from the Services. There are no guarantees that a transfer initiated via your wallet on the Services, including those run locally by you, will successfully transfer title of or right in any digital assets.

You acknowledge that the Websites and the Tools could have bugs or security vulnerabilities, and you hereby accept this risk. You hereby hold us and our service providers harmless from any losses you suffer as a result of your use of the Websites and/or any Services, including those run locally by you, which you agree you use at your sole risk.

To the extent you run any Services related to digital assets, including locally, the digital assets and use of your wallet and the Services may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious actors may attempt to interfere with the Websites and/or the Services or your use thereof in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, use of malware, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, and spoofing. Furthermore, because much of the Websites and/or the Services rely on open source software, there is the software underlying our code that may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Websites and/or the Services, or result in the loss of your digital assets, or your ability to control your wallet. You hold us and our service providers harmless from and against any losses you suffer as a result of such issues.
