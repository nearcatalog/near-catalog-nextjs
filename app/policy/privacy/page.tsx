* Details of your visits to the Website, the Apps and the Tools, including traffic data, browsing patterns, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website, the Apps and the Tools; and  
* Information about your device and about your internet connection and service provider, as set forth above.

We and our service providers also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).

The information we and our service providers collect automatically may be statistical data and may also include personal information, or we and our service providers may maintain it or associate it with personal information we each collect in other ways or receive from third parties. This information enables us and our service providers to:

* Allow you to use and access the Website, the Apps and the Tools;  
* Prevent fraudulent activity and improve security functionality;  
* Assess the performance of the Website, the Apps and the Tools, including as part of our and our service providers’ analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Website, the Apps and the Tools;  
* Offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Website, the Apps and the Tools, including identifying you when you sign into the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and keeping track of your specified preferences;

* Estimate our and our service providers’ audience size and usage patterns;

* Analyze our and our service providers’ services and products and perform market research.

When you visit or leave the Website, the Apps and the Tools by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a third-party site that includes our and our service providers’ plugins or cookies (or similar technology), we and our service providers may automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed.

We and our service providers may also receive location data passed to each of us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we and our service providers may use to show you local information when using the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and for fraud prevention and security purposes. We and our service providers may use this information to provide customized services, content, and other information that may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish for us, our affiliates, or our service providers to collect and use location information, you may disable the location features on your device. Consult your device manufacturer settings for instructions on how to do this. Please note that if you disable such features, your ability to access certain features, services, content, or products may be limited or disabled.  
The technologies we and our service providers use for this automatic data collection may include:

* Cookies (or browser cookies). Cookies are small text files stored through a browser on a computing or mobile device. Cookies help you navigate website pages efficiently and may improve your user experience. Note that while you can set your browser to not allow cookies, we and our service providers may not be able to honor that request, and may track your activity and collect information about you and your online activities even when the browser is set to “do not track”;  
* Flash Cookies. Certain features of the Website, the Apps and the Tools may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on the Website, the Apps and the Tools. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies and you may not be able to shut down our and our service providers’ collection of and use of information through this technology;  
* Web Beacons, Pixels and Tags. Pages of the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and our and our service providers’ e-mails, may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us and our service providers, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity);  
* Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, the Apps and the Tools, such as information about the links you click on;  
* ETag, or entity tag. An ETag, or entity tag, is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation. These allow websites to be more efficient and not serve content again, when data is already cached and ready to view;  
* Fingerprinting. Fingerprinting refers to the collection and analysis of information from your device, such as your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification;  
* Recognition Technologies. Recognition technologies refers to various technology features used by websites, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user); and  
* Log Files. These track actions occurring on the Website, the Apps and the Tools, which help us and our service providers collect your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, the webpages from which you came or to which you go before and after visiting the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and the date and time of your visits.

## Behavioral Advertising

We and our service providers may use your personal information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications that we each believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work).

## Do Not Track

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a concept promoted by certain regulatory authorities and industry groups for development and implementation of a mechanism that would allow internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that allows a user to set a preference in the browser to not have his/her activities on the internet tracked. You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. When a user’s browser is set to DNT, some cookies and other tracking technologies may become inactive, depending on how the website visited responds to DNT browser settings. If that occurs, the website visited will not recognize you upon return to that website, save your passwords or user names, and some other features of a website may become unavailable or not function properly.

## Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website, the Apps and the Tools may be served by third-parties (in addition to our service providers who provide the Tools), including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Website, the Apps and the Tools. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.  
We and our service providers do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

## How We and Our Service Providers Use Your Information

## Data Security

We and our service providers have implemented measures intended to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we or our service providers have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, the Apps and the Tools, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We and our service providers ask you not to share your password with anyone and to change your password from time to time. We and our service providers also highly recommend that you use a password that is dissimilar to and cannot be easily found by unauthorized third parties who may have obtained your login credentials to other sites. Keep in mind that if you use the same password for all websites, if someone obtains your credentials for one site, they may be able to then use those credentials to log into any other site you use.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we and our service providers try to protect your personal information, we and our service providers cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through or collected through the use of the Website, the Apps and the Tools. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.

We and our service providers are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website, the Apps and the Tools.

Please note that certain terms used in this California-specific section of the privacy policy, such as “Personal Information,” “Sale,” “Share” and “Sensitive Personal Information” have the meanings given to such terms in the CCPA/CPRA, and not the common meanings of these terms in conversational English. The CCPA does not apply to certain information, which may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or certain other state or federal privacy laws.

## California Residents 

## California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, known as the “*Shine The Light*” law, permits users of the Website, the Apps and the Tools who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding year, and the names and addresses of those third parties.

To make such a request, please send an email to [admin@banyan.gg](mailto:toadmin@banyan.gg). 

## Do Not Track and Global Privacy Controls

The Website, the Apps and the Tools respond to currently available global privacy control (“GPC”) signals. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Website, the Apps and the Tools up to date so that we can continue to respond to such opt-out request as the technology changes over time.

If you choose not to be tracked while visiting the Website, the Apps and the Tools, you can visit your browser privacy settings to make the selection, and specifically turn on a “do not track” or other global privacy control setting made available, to send signals that you wish not to have your information collected as you browse. This election is often available under the cookies related privacy settings for your browser.

Not all browsers have GPC extensions at this time. Please visit the website for the company that offers your browser to see if they have a GPC extension and to learn how to download it. For example, Mozilla explains how to enable their experimental GPC control here: [https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/).
